      <h3>Etiquette and Rules of Conduct</h3>
      <div class="content">

      <p>The Dojang is a place to learn both Taekwondo techniques and mental discipline. Members of the club play a key role in helping each other to grow both physically and mentally. It is thus critically important that members of the club show respect for each other. Members of the club should take pride in how they conduct themselves both while in the Dojang and also in their normal daily activities.</p>

      <p>The classroom setting is not the place for uncontrolled aggression or mean-spirited behavior. It is our goal for everyone to feel respected and complete each class safely.</p>

      <h4>Etiquette</h4>
        <p>As you become a member of the Dojang, you will begin to see the importance of the proper etiquette to the training process. The Dojang is a very special place. Below is a list of basic etiquette rules to be followed in the Dojang:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Bow to the flags when entering or leaving the Dojang.</li>
          <li> At the beginning of class students line up according to seniority (rank first and then age) with the most senior member to the front right.</li>
          <li>Address the instructor as 'Sir' and 'Madam' during class. In addition, all black belt members should be addressed by their last name. </li>
          <li>If you have a question wait for an appropriate moment to ask politely. Do not interrupt if someone is speaking.</li>
          <li>If coming late to class, you should wait for the permission of the instructor to enter the Dojang. Sit quietly at the side, raise your hand, and wait for the instructor to see you. </li>
          <li>Members should help keep the Dojang clean. All personal belongings should be kept out of the training area. Every student is responsible for his/her own valuables. </li>
          <li>If it should be necessary for a student to leave the Dojang before the class is over please notify the instructor.</li>
          <li>Outside of class it is not asked that students address instructors or black belts formally but they should still be shown respect. </li>
          <li>Keep your uniform clean and in good repair. When adjusting your uniform in class you should turn away from others. </li>
          <li>Treat your belt with the same respect that you would a flag. Do not allow it to become soiled or damaged.</li>
        </ol>
