        <p>The Taekwondo Club instructors are selected from the club membership on the basis of their prior experience (rank), teaching ability and commitment. Our instructors volunteer their time out of passion for the art of Taekwondo, an interest in learning from other club members, and a dedication to teaching.</p>
