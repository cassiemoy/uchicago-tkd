      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The University of Chicago Taekwondo Club is a recognized student sport club. For over a decade the Taekwondo Club has made high quality Taekwondo training available to the university community.</p>

        <p>Taekwondo can be roughly translated as "The Way of the Hand and Foot" and is a traditional Korean martial art. Officially introduced as an Olympic Sport in 2000 and thought to be the world's most popular martial art, Taekwondo has a history that stretches back to ancient Korea. As the name suggests, Taekwondo is more than a sport or fighting style, it is a way of life. The ultimate goal of Taekwondo is self improvement through disciplining the mind and conditioning the body.</p>

        <p>The University of Chicago Taekwondo Club is led and taught by volunteer members of the university community. As our instructors come from a variety of training backgrounds there is a diversity of style not present in many traditional schools. This results in a training environment that is collaborative rather than dogmatic.</p> 

        <p>The University of Chicago Taekwondo Club has chosen not to affiliated with any Taekwondo association. This choice was made because our instructors and many of our students come from different associations. This also allows us to maintain an open learning environment and keep costs very low.</p> 

        <p>For anyone interested in learning a martial art or improving their physical fitnes in a friendly environment, the Taekwondo Club is an excellent choice. We welcome students of all skill levels and types of martial arts experience. Please contact an instructor if you have questions. If you want to know if Taekwondo is for you, the best way to find out is to try a class.</p>

        <p>The University of Chicago restricts participation in the Taekwondo Club to students, alumni, staff and faculty at the University. Spouses (but not children) of the aforementioned persons are also allowed to participate. Additionally, as all classes are held in the Ratner Center, a gym membership is required.</p>
